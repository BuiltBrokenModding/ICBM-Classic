# Clarification

All assets are licensed from artists as either their current license or non-exlusive non-transferable non-revokable aggrement for the project. Artist maintain full rights to their works to do as they decide.

## What this means

The MIT license of the project only applies to source code and data files created by the team. Files such as textures, sounds, models, and other assets are not. They can be used as part of the project only and can't be distributed as part of a new project. As the project evolved all assets will be documented with their original author and license.
