# Clarification

All assets are licensed from artists as either their current license or non-exlusive non-transferable non-revokable aggrement for the project. Artist maintain full rights to their works to do as they decide.

## What this means

It means that even though the rest of the project is MIT license the textures, sounds, models, and other assets are not. They can be used as part of the project only and can't be distributed as part of a new project.
