Current objective for work on the project

Objective: Graphics Overhaul for `v5.x.x` release

## Issues

- Screen is overriding cruise launcher target set actively (should only do this when remotely triggered)
- Can offhand use radar gun, laser, or remote for various features

## GUI

### Radar

- Show impact locations on map
- Update to use actual entity icons instead of just dots

### Silo Screen

- Show status of all launchers instead of first

### Launch Pad

- Add launch delay

## Missiles/Launcher Work Left

- Glass texture render
- Engine smoke position
- Engine smoke color
- GUI item render scale
- Frame item render scale
- Silo rendering missiles as a block state
- Redmatter fluid in missile, have it move in circle for center tank and left-right inverse on lower tubes. 2 pixels left, 2 pixels right, repeat to give a centrifuge like visual.
- Render cable coming from frame to missile. Recycle rope render from minecraft and increase in size

## Block Textures

- connected textures for launcher connector
- glass connected textures

## Items

- RPG Model
- Render warhead from each model on RPG
- Laser Det
- Defuser
- Grenades
- Carts
- Steel clump
- Bronze clump
