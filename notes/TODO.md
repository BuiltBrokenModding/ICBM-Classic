# TODO

## Missiles/Launcher Work Left

- Engine smoke position
- Engine smoke color
- Redmatter fluid in missile, have it move in circle for center tank and left-right inverse on lower tubes. 2 pixels left, 2 pixels right, repeat to give a centrifuge like visual.
- Render cable coming from frame to missile. Recycle rope render from minecraft and increase in size

## Block Textures

- connected textures for launcher connector
- glass connected textures

## Entity Textures

- Redmatter Spiral
- Fragment 

## Issues

- Disabled icon for radio hover is too hard to tell apart from normal, consider color shift or hard boarder
